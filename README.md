Part I: Research Question

A. Relevant Question:
-I outline a pertinent question or decision that can be addressed using the selected data set, aligning with a realistic organizational need or situation.

B. Variable Description:
-I provide a comprehensive description of all variables in the data set, showcasing data types for each variable with illustrative examples from the dataset.


Part II: Data-Cleaning Plan

C. Data-Cleaning Plan:
-I propose a detailed plan incorporating pertinent techniques and specific steps for assessing data quality in the chosen dataset.
-I justify the approach, considering characteristics of the data, and detail the chosen assessment methodology.
-I rationalize the selection of Python as the programming language and relevant libraries for efficient data cleaning, providing annotated code for data quality assessment.


Part III: Data Cleaning

D. Data-Cleaning Process:
-I summarize the findings from the data quality assessment, identifying issues in the dataset.
-Methods for mitigating data quality issues are justified, and outcomes of each data-cleaning step are presented.
-Annotated code for mitigating data quality issues, including anomalies, is provided in an executable script file.
-The cleaned data set is presented in a CSV file.
-I outline the limitations of the data-cleaning process.
-A discussion ensues regarding how the identified limitations may impact the subsequent analysis of the question or decision posed in Part I.

E. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
-I apply PCA to identify significant features, providing the total number of principal components and presenting the output of the principal components loading matrix.
-I justify the reduced number of principal components, incorporating a screenshot of a scree plot.
-I describe the organizational benefits stemming from the application of PCA, elucidating its impact on data understanding and decision-making processes.
